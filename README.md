### Introduction
BIONIC is a deep-learning based biological network integration algorithm that uses graph convolutional networks (GCN) to
learn integrated features for genes or proteins across input networks. BIONIC produces high-quality node features and is
scalable both in number of networks and network size.

An overview of BIONIC can be seen below.
